# 🚀 Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

---

## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### ▶️ `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### 🧪 `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

---

### 🏗️ `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

- The build is minified.
- Filenames include the hashes.
- Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### ⚠️ `npm run eject`

> **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.  
This command will:

- Remove the single build dependency from your project.
- Copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.
- Allow full control over the configuration.

All the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.  
You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments.
